### The functional development of inhibitory circuits

Our lab investigates how the heterochronicity (i.e. the diversity of timing/speed) of developmental programs shapes inhibitory circuits, focusing particularly on parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. 
We posit that PV interneurons are especially susceptible to altered developmental trajectories due to their prolonged and activity-dependent maturation process. 

Previous research from our team and others demonstrated that abnormalities in PV interneuron development lead to far-reaching effects on network dynamics. 
Specifically, PV disruptions lead to altered developmental shift of the excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio towards inhibition, impair the decorrelation of brain activity, 
hinder the reduction of neural oligarchy (where a few high-firing neurons disproportionately influence network activity), and compromise the emergence of gamma oscillations, which
are a key oscillatory phenomenon associated with cognitive processes. Ultimately, these network-level disruptions have significant implications for behavior.

Our ultimate goal is to establish clear links between genetic mutations and altered developmental programs on the one hand, and circuit-level dysfunction, network dynamics, and behavioral phenotypes on the other. 
By elucidating these connections in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, we aim to identify translational biomarkers that can inform early diagnosis and targeted interventions in neurodevelopmental disorders.

To achieve these objectives, our lab integrates a diverse set of cutting-edge techniques. These include acute and chronic in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations, 
and detailed morphological and immunohistochemical analyses. We also employ spiking neural network modeling and comprehensive behavioral assessments to bridge our findings from genes and molecular pathways to complex cognitive behaviors. 
The ultimate goal is to use this multidisciplinary approach to develop systems-level therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to address neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Early involvement of higher-order brain areas in controlling innate behaviors

A related, yet distinct line of research in our lab addresses the early functional involvement of higher-order brain areas in innate behaviors critical for survival. 
Traditionally, higher-order cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, have been considered behaviorally dormant during early postnatal life due to their protracted developmental timeline. 
According to this view, early innate behaviors were thought to mainly rely on lower-order cortical and subcortical circuits. 

However, we belive that this dogma could be wrong. We are investigating how, already in the very first days of life, higher-order regions might be involved in orchestrating survival-relevant behaviors
such as threat avoidance and ultrasonic vocalizations.

We believe that understanding how higher-order brain areas shape early innate behaviors might offer a unique opportunity to identify early-life network disruptions linked to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
