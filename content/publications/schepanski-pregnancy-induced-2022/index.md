abstract: Life-long brain function and mental health are critically determined by
  developmental processes occurring before birth. During mammalian pregnancy, maternal
  cells are transferred to the fetus. They are referred to as maternal microchimeric
  cells (MMc). Among other organs, MMc seed into the fetal brain, where their function
  is unknown. Here, we show that, in the offspring’s developing brain in mice, MMc
  express a unique signature of sensome markers, control microglia homeostasis and
  prevent excessive presynaptic elimination. Further, MMc facilitate the oscillatory
  entrainment of developing prefrontal-hippocampal circuits and support the maturation
  of behavioral abilities. Our findings highlight that MMc are not a mere placental
  leak out, but rather a functional mechanism that shapes optimal conditions for healthy
  brain function later in life.
