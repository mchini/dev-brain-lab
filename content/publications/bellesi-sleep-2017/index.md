abstract: We previously found that Mertk and its ligand Gas6, astrocytic genes involved
  in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested
  that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct
  evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases
  peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with
  neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune
  cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy
  to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes
  in mouse frontal cortex after 6–8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation
  (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis,
  mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and
  chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation
  in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep
  loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response
  to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn
  components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that
  CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced
  microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation
  in the CSF. Because low-level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal
  responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss,
  through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage. SIGNIFICANCE
  STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic
  origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep
  deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe
  sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and
  strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake.
  By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia,
  promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of
  neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption
  may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's
  susceptibility to other forms of damage.
