abstract: General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness
  accompanied by transient amnesia. Yet, long-term memory impairment is an undesirable
  side effect. How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus,
  a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood.
  Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging, and behavioral analysis,
  we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF),
  and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics
  in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity,
  decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered
  spine dynamics. CA1 network activity under all 3 anesthetics was different to natural
  sleep. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled unperturbed activity during wakefulness
  and sleep, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and
  MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl
  and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network
  dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for
  GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.
