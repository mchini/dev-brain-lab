            The Chini lab has roots at the ZMNH in Hamburg, in the <a href="https://www.opatzlab.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#3182ce;font-weight:bold;">lab</a>
            of Ileana Hanganu-Opatz, where a part of the team is still located. We are in the process of establishing a new site at
            <a href="https://www.giga.uliege.be/" target="_blank" style="color:#3182ce;font-weight:bold;">GIGA Institute</a> in Liège. The lab in Liège is generously funded by a MISU grant of the FNRS and will start in January 2026. We are looking for new members to
            <a href="/opportunities/" style="color:#3182ce;font-weight:bold;">join the team</a>. The address below refers to our new home at GIGA.
