I am excited to share that, together with Irina Pochinok from the Hamburg faction of the lab, I will co-organise two events at the Bernstein Conference 2025 in Frankfurt.

### PhD Symposium – 28 September 2025
We will open the conference open with the PhD Symposium on 29 September 2025. This event supports early‑career scientists. Young researchers will present and get direct feedback. The symposium highlights fresh ideas and invites lively discussion.

Satellite Workshop – 29–30 September 2025
Next, we host a Satellite Workshop on 29 and 30 September 2025. Its theme: Consistency in computational neuroscience—exploring methods that ensure reliable, interpretable models of brain dynamics. We will focus on bridging machine‑learning techniques and mechanistic modeling.

Why this matters
Our symposium builds community among early‑career researchers. Our workshop fosters methodological rigor in the field. Both events create an ideal springboard for CON2PHYS—a new initiative I have developed to study physical constraints and consistency in computational brain models. CON2PHYS aims to combine robust data‑driven methods with biophysical interpretation.

Personal note
I serve the lab in Hamburg and here in Aachen. These events reflect our commitment to training young scientists and advancing modeling consistency. I feel proud to bring CON2PHYS into the Bernstein community. This platform will shape collaborations and inspire new directions.

Conference overview
The main conference runs 29 September to 2 October 2025 at Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. The Bernstein Conference is Europe’s largest annual computational neuroscience meeting. It attracts students, postdocs, and PIs from across the world.
