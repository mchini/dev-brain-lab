# Two Postdoctoral Positions in Neuroscience  
**Chini Lab, GIGA Institute, University of Liège**

The newly established **Chini Lab** at the **GIGA Institute**, University of Liège, Belgium, is seeking two highly motivated postdoctoral researchers 
to join an FNRS fully funded project exploring neural development, systems neuroscience, and circuit dysfunction linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

## Project Summary

The project investigates network-level disruptions associated with impaired development of inhibitory circuits in a subtype of ASD. 
Using cutting-edge in vivo electrophysiology (Neuropixels recordings), behavioral testing, opto- and chemo-genetic techniques, 
and spiking neural network modeling, we aim to uncover translational biomarkers and fundamental mechanisms underlying 
altered inhibitory circuits and network dynamics. The project offers significant opportunities for scientific growth, 
interdisciplinary collaboration, and method development.

## Position 1 – Computational/System Neuroscience

The ideal candidate will lead computational analyses of large-scale electrophysiological datasets and neural circuit modeling. 
Tasks include advanced time-series analysis (SUA, LFP), and developing spiking neural network models to interpret developmental circuit dysfunction 
and linking experimental data to theoretical frameworks.

### Requirements

- PhD in neuroscience or a related field
- Strong programming skills, ideally in Python (MATLAB or R also okay)
- Experience with time-series analysis and neural network modeling (preferred)
- Experience in analysis of large-scale in vivo electrophysiology datasets (preferred)
- Familiarity with advanced statistical modeling (advantageous)
- Familiarity with in-vivo electrophysiology (advantageous)
- Not have worked in Belgium for the past 5 years

## Position 2 – Experimental/System Neuroscience

The successful candidate will perform in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral tests, investigating developmental trajectories and network-level dysfunction 
in a mouse model of an ASD subtype. 
Responsibilities include stereotactic surgeries, viral vector manipulation, in vivo electrophysiology, opto/chemogenetic experiments, behavioral testing.

### Requirements

- PhD in neuroscience or related discipline
- Strong experience with in vivo electrophysiology and rodent behavioral testing (strongly preferred)
- Expertise in stereotactic surgeries and viral vector approaches (strongly preferred)
- Expertise in opto- and chemo-genetic experiments (beneficial)
- Familiarity with in vitro electrophysiology and confocal microscopy techniques (beneficial)
- Experience in analysis of large-scale in vivo electrophysiology datasets (beneficial)
- Not have worked in Belgium for the past 5 years

## What We Offer

- Competitive salary funded by the FNRS
- Two-year contracts with the possibility of a one-year extension (2+1 years)
- A supportive and collaborative research environment
- Commitment to work-life balance and a family-friendly environment
- Beautiful forest surrounding the lab, great bike commuting possibilities
- Opportunities to develop and collaborate on projects beyond the funded research
