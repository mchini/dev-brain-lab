# Two Postdoctoral Positions in Neuroscience  
**Chini Lab, GIGA Institute, University of Liège**

The newly established **Chini Lab** at the **GIGA Institute**, University of Liège, Belgium, is seeking two highly motivated postdoctoral researchers 
to join an FNRS-funded project exploring neural development, systems neuroscience, and circuit dysfunction linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

## Project Summary

The project investigates network-level disruptions associated with impaired development of inhibitory circuits in an ASD subtype. 
Using cutting-edge in vivo electrophysiology (Neuropixels recordings), behavioral testing, opto/chemo-genetic techniques, 
and spiking neural network modeling, we aim to uncover translational biomarkers and fundamental mechanisms underlying 
altered inhibitory circuits and network dynamics. The project offers significant opportunities for scientific growth, 
interdisciplinary collaboration, and method development.

## Position 1 – Computational/System Neuroscience

The ideal candidate will lead computational analyses of large-scale electrophysiological datasets and neural circuit modeling. 
Tasks include advanced time-series analysis (SUA, LFP), and developing spiking neural network models to interpret developmental circuit dysfunction 
and link experimental data to theoretical frameworks.

### Requirements

- PhD in neuroscience or a related field
- Strong programming skills, ideally in Python (MATLAB or R also okay)
- Experience with time-series analysis and neural network modeling (preferred)
- Familiarity with analysis of large-scale in vivo electrophysiology datasets (preferred)
- Familiarity with advanced statistical modeling (advantageous)
- Not have lived/worked in Belgium for more than 24 months in the past 3 years

## Position 2 – Experimental/System Neuroscience

The successful candidate will perform in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral tests, investigating developmental trajectories and network-level dysfunction 
in a mouse model of an ASD subtype. 
Responsibilities include stereotactic surgeries, viral vector manipulation, in vivo electrophysiology, opto/chemo-genetic experiments, behavioral testing,
confocal imaging and image analysis.

### Requirements

- PhD in neuroscience or related discipline
- Strong experience with in vivo electrophysiology and rodent behavioral testing (strongly preferred)
- Expertise in stereotactic surgeries and viral vector approaches (strongly preferred)
- Expertise in opto/chemo-genetic experiments (beneficial)
- Familiarity with in vitro electrophysiology and confocal microscopy techniques (beneficial)
- Experience in analysis of large-scale in vivo electrophysiology datasets (beneficial)
- Not have lived/worked in Belgium for more than 24 months in the past 3 years
