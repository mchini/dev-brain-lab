abstract: Throughout development, the brain transits from early highly synchronous
  activity patterns to a mature state with sparse and decorrelated neural activity,
  yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. The developmental
  transition has important functional consequences, as the latter state is thought
  to allow for more efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of information. Here,
  we show that, in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), neural activity during
  the first two postnatal weeks decorrelates following specific spatial patterns.
  This process is accompanied by a concomitant tilting of excitation-inhibition (E-I)
  ratio toward inhibition. Using optogenetic manipulations and neural network modeling,
  we show that the two phenomena are mechanistically linked, and that a relative increase
  of inhibition drives the decorrelation of neural activity. Accordingly, in mice
  mimicking the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, subtle alterations in E-I
  ratio are associated with specific impairments in the correlational structure of
  spike trains. Finally, capitalizing on EEG data from newborn babies, we show that
  an analogous developmental transition takes place also in the human brain. Thus,
  changes in E-I ratio control the (de)correlation of neural activity and, by these
  means, its developmental imbalance might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental
  disorders.
