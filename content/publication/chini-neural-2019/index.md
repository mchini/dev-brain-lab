abstract: Monitoring the hypnotic component of anesthesia during surgeries is critical
  to prevent intraoperative awareness and reduce adverse side effects. For this purpose,
  electroencephalographic methods complementing measures of autonomic functions and
  behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. However, in human neonates
  and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the correlation between brain
  activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly understood. Here, we characterize
  the effects of different anesthetics on activity of several brain areas in neonatal
  mice and develop machine learning approaches to identify electrophysiological features
  predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic concentration as a proxy for anesthetic
  depth. We show that similar features from electroencephalographic recordings can
  be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice, and human neonates
  and infants. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor anesthetic
  depth in human newborns.
