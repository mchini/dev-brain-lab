abstract: Sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are a hippocampal network phenomenon critical
  for memory consolidation and planning. SPW-Rs have been extensively studied in the
  adult brain, yet their developmental trajectory is poorly understood. While SPWs
  have been recorded in rodents shortly after birth, the time point and mechanisms
  of ripple emergence are still unclear. Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology
  with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12-day-old mice to address this knowledge
  gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation
  of channelrhodopsin-2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day
  10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the
  maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by
  reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons. Finally, we
  show that early SPW-Rs elicit a more robust prefrontal cortex response than SPWs
  lacking ripples. Thus, development of inhibition promotes ripples emergence.
