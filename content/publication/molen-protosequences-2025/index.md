abstract: Neuronal firing sequences are thought to be the basic building blocks of
  neural coding and information broadcasting within the brain. However, when sequences
  emerge during neurodevelopment remains unknown. We demonstrate that structured firing
  sequences are present in spontaneous activity of human and murine brain organoids
  and ex vivo neonatal brain slices from the murine somatosensory cortex. We observed
  a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent
  phenomena in human and murine brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory
  cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that
  temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather
  constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis.
  These findings highlight the potential for brain organoids to further explore how
  exogenous inputs can be used to refine neuronal circuits and enable new studies
  into the genetic mechanisms that govern assembly of functional circuitry during
  early human brain development.
