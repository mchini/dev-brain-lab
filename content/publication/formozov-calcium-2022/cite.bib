 abstract = {The acute effects of anesthesia and their underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Thus, comprehensive analysis and efficient generalization require their description in various brain regions. Here we describe a large-scale, annotated collection of 2-photon calcium imaging data and multi-electrode, extracellular electrophysiological recordings in CA1 of the murine hippocampus under three distinct anesthetics (Isoflurane, Ketamine/Xylazine and Medetomidine/Midazolam/Fentanyl), during natural sleep, and wakefulness. We cover several aspects of data quality standardization and provide a set of tools for autonomous validation, along with analysis workflows for reuse and data exploration. The datasets described here capture various aspects of neural activity in hundreds of pyramidal cells at single cell resolution. In addition to relevance for basic biological research, the dataset may find utility in computational neuroscience as a benchmark for models of anesthesia and sleep.},
