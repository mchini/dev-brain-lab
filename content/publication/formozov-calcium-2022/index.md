abstract: The acute effects of anesthesia and their underlying mechanisms are still
  not fully understood. Thus, comprehensive analysis and efficient generalization
  require their description in various brain regions. Here we describe a large-scale,
  annotated collection of 2-photon calcium imaging data and multi-electrode, extracellular
  electrophysiological recordings in CA1 of the murine hippocampus under three distinct
  anesthetics (Isoflurane, Ketamine/Xylazine and Medetomidine/Midazolam/Fentanyl),
  during natural sleep, and wakefulness. We cover several aspects of data quality
  standardization and provide a set of tools for autonomous validation, along with
  analysis workflows for reuse and data exploration. The datasets described here capture
  various aspects of neural activity in hundreds of pyramidal cells at single cell
  resolution. In addition to relevance for basic biological research, the dataset
  may find utility in computational neuroscience as a benchmark for models of anesthesia
  and sleep.
