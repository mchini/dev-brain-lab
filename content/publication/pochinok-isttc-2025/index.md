abstract: "Intrinsic neural timescales (ITs) are an emerging measure of how neural circuits integrate information over time. ITs are dynamically regulated by behavioral context and cognitive demands, making them suitable for mapping high-level cognitive phenomena onto the underlying neural computations. In particular, IT measurements derived from single-unit activity (SUA) offer fine-grained resolution, critical for mechanistically linking individual neuron dynamics to cognition. However, current methods for estimating ITs from SUA suffer significant biases and instabilities, particularly when applied to sparse, noisy, or epoched neural spike data. Here, we introduce the intrinsic Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (iSTTC), a novel metric specifically developed to address these limitations. Leveraging synthetic and experimental single-unit recordings, we systematically assessed the performance of iSTTC relative to traditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate that iSTTC provides more accurate estimates of neural timescales across a wide range of conditions, reducing estimation error especially under challenging yet biologically relevant conditions. Crucially, iSTTC can be applied to both continuous and epoched data, overcoming a critical limitation of existing methods. Furthermore, iSTTC substantially relaxes inclusion criteria, increasing the fraction of neurons suitable for analysis and thereby improving the representativeness and robustness of IT measurements. The methodological advances introduced by iSTTC represent a substantial step forward in accurately capturing neural circuit dynamics, ultimately enhancing our ability to link neural mechanisms to cognitive phenomena."
