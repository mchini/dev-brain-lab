abstract: The mouse cortex is a canonical model for studying how functional neural
  networks emerge, yet it remains unclear which topological features arise from intrinsic
  cellular organization versus external regional cues. Mouse forebrain organoids provide
  a powerful system to investigate these intrinsic mechanisms. We generated dorsal
  (DF) and ventral (VF) forebrain organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells and
  tracked their development using longitudinal electrophysiology. DF organoids showed
  progressively stronger network-wide correlations, while VF organoids developed more
  refined activity patterns, enhanced small-world topology, and increased modular
  organization. These differences emerged without extrinsic inputs and may be driven
  by the increased generation of Pvalb+ interneurons in VF organoids. Our findings
  demonstrate how variations in cellular composition influence the self-organization
  of neural circuits, establishing mouse forebrain organoids as a tractable platform
  to study how neuronal populations shape cortical network architecture.
