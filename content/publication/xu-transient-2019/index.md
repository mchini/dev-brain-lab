abstract: Compromised brain development has been hypothesized to account for mental
  illness. This concept was underpinned by the function of the molecule disrupted-in-schizophrenia
  1 (DISC1), which represents an intracellular hub of developmental processes and
  has been related to cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Mice with whole-brain
  DISC1 knock-down show impaired prefrontal–hippocampal function and cognitive abilities
  throughout development and at adulthood, especially when combined with early environmental
  stressors, such as maternal immune activation (MIA). However, the contribution of
  abnormal DISC1-driven maturation of either prefrontal cortex (PFC) or hippocampus
  (HP) to these deficits is still unknown. Here, we use in utero electroporation to
  restrict the DISC1 knock-down to prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons during
  perinatal development and expose these mice to MIA as an environmental stressor
  (dual-hit GPFCE mice, both sexes). Combining in vivo electrophysiology and neuroanatomy
  with behavioral testing, we show that GPFCE mice at neonatal age have abnormal patterns
  of oscillatory activity and firing in PFC, but not HP. Abnormal firing rates in
  PFC of GPFCE mice relate to sparser dendritic arborization and lower spine density.
  Moreover, the long-range coupling within prefrontal–hippocampal networks is decreased
  at this age. The transient prefrontal DISC1 knock-down was sufficient to permanently
  perturb the prefrontal–hippocampal communication and caused poorer recognition memory
  performance at pre-juvenile age. Thus, developmental dysfunction of prefrontal circuitry
  causes long-lasting disturbances related to mental illness. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
  Hypofrontality is considered a main cause of cognitive deficits in mental disorders,
  yet the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. During development, long
  before the emergence of disease symptoms, the functional coupling within the prefrontal–hippocampal
  network, which is the core brain circuit involved in cognitive processing, is reduced.
  To assess to which extent impaired prefrontal development contributes to the early
  dysfunction, immune-challenged mice with transient DISC1 knock-down confined to
  PFC were investigated in their prefrontal–hippocampal communication throughout development
  by in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral testing. We show that perturbing developmental
  processes of prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons is sufficient to diminish
  prefrontal–hippocampal coupling and decrease the cognitive performance throughout
  development.
