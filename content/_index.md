        Neurons usually “talk” by sending quick electric signals called spikes. If I asked you to picture your brain falling completely silent for multiple seconds, 
        you might think of coma, anesthesia, or even death. Yet, silence is how every brain starts out.
        The video above captures the real-time activity of hundreds of neurons in a healthy mouse. Each circle is a spike, a rare event drowned in an ocean of silence. 
        These long silent phases are a hallmark of early brain development, and it’s just one of the many mysteries that make this period so fascinating. This is what we study in the Chini lab.
