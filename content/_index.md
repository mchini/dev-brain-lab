        In the Chini lab, we study how the brain develops. 

        We are fascinated by how the first sparks of brain activity mature into the neural networks that let us do all the complex behaviors that truly make us human.
        We aim to uncover the principles that guide the maturation of the subtle balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and how through their tug-of-war that unfolds over development emerge complex neural dynamics.
        To answer these questions, we combine high-density in vivo electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics in neonatal mice. We pair experiments with spiking neural network models to test mechanisms, and we aim at validating our findings against human neonatal EEG.
        Our long-term aim is to use the tools of modern system neuroscience to advance our understanding of the very first steps of brain development, and to translate these insights into novel approaches to alter the course of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia.
