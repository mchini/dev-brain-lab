	abstract = {We previously found that Mertk and its ligand Gas6, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6–8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low-level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.},

	abstract = {Throughout development, the brain transits from early highly synchronous activity patterns to a mature state with sparse and decorrelated neural activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. The developmental transition has important functional consequences, as the latter state is thought to allow for more efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of information. Here, we show that, in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), neural activity during the first two postnatal weeks decorrelates following specific spatial patterns. This process is accompanied by a concomitant tilting of excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio toward inhibition. Using optogenetic manipulations and neural network modeling, we show that the two phenomena are mechanistically linked, and that a relative increase of inhibition drives the decorrelation of neural activity. Accordingly, in mice mimicking the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, subtle alterations in E-I ratio are associated with specific impairments in the correlational structure of spike trains. Finally, capitalizing on EEG data from newborn babies, we show that an analogous developmental transition takes place also in the human brain. Thus, changes in E-I ratio control the (de)correlation of neural activity and, by these means, its developmental imbalance might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Exploration of a novel environment leads to neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These DSBs are generated by type 2 topoisomerase to relieve topological constrains that limit transcription of plasticity-related immediate early genes. If not promptly repaired, however, DSBs may lead to cell death. Since the induction of plasticity-related genes is higher in wake than in sleep, we asked whether it is specifically wake associated with synaptic plasticity that leads to DSBs, and whether sleep provides any selective advantage over wake in their repair. In flies and mice, we find that enriched wake, more than simply time spent awake, induces DSBs, and their repair in mice is delayed or prevented by subsequent wake. In both species the repair of irradiation-induced neuronal DSBs is also quicker during sleep, and mouse genes mediating the response to DNA damage are upregulated in sleep. Thus, sleep facilitates the repair of neuronal DSBs.},

How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus, a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood. Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging, and behavioral analysis, we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF), and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity, decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered spine dynamics. CA1 network activity under all 3 anesthetics was different to natural sleep. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled unperturbed activity during wakefulness and sleep, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.},

Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations.

We show that similar features from electroencephalographic recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice, and human neonates and infants.

	abstract = {Compromised brain development has been hypothesized to account for mental illness. This concept was underpinned by the function of the molecule disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which represents an intracellular hub of developmental processes and has been related to cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Mice with whole-brain DISC1 knock-down show impaired prefrontal–hippocampal function and cognitive abilities throughout development and at adulthood, especially when combined with early environmental stressors, such as maternal immune activation (MIA). However, the contribution of abnormal DISC1-driven maturation of either prefrontal cortex (PFC) or hippocampus (HP) to these deficits is still unknown. Here, we use in utero electroporation to restrict the DISC1 knock-down to prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons during perinatal development and expose these mice to MIA as an environmental stressor (dual-hit GPFCE mice, both sexes). Combining in vivo electrophysiology and neuroanatomy with behavioral testing, we show that GPFCE mice at neonatal age have abnormal patterns of oscillatory activity and firing in PFC, but not HP. Abnormal firing rates in PFC of GPFCE mice relate to sparser dendritic arborization and lower spine density. Moreover, the long-range coupling within prefrontal–hippocampal networks is decreased at this age. The transient prefrontal DISC1 knock-down was sufficient to permanently perturb the prefrontal–hippocampal communication and caused poorer recognition memory performance at pre-juvenile age. Thus, developmental dysfunction of prefrontal circuitry causes long-lasting disturbances related to mental illness.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hypofrontality is considered a main cause of cognitive deficits in mental disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. During development, long before the emergence of disease symptoms, the functional coupling within the prefrontal–hippocampal network, which is the core brain circuit involved in cognitive processing, is reduced. To assess to which extent impaired prefrontal development contributes to the early dysfunction, immune-challenged mice with transient DISC1 knock-down confined to PFC were investigated in their prefrontal–hippocampal communication throughout development by in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral testing. We show that perturbing developmental processes of prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons is sufficient to diminish prefrontal–hippocampal coupling and decrease the cognitive performance throughout development.},

Here, we show that, in the offspring’s developing brain in mice, MMc express a unique signature of sensome markers, control microglia homeostasis and prevent excessive presynaptic elimination. Further, MMc facilitate the oscillatory entrainment of developing prefrontal-hippocampal circuits and support the maturation of behavioral abilities. Our findings highlight that MMc are not a mere placental leak out, but rather a functional mechanism that shapes optimal conditions for healthy brain function later in life.},

To which extent they reproduce common patterns of dysfunction related to mental illness and abnormal processes of maturation is still largely unknown. While the devastating symptoms of disease are firstly detectable in adulthood, they are considered to reflect profound miswiring of brain circuitry as result of abnormal development. To reveal whether different disease models share common dysfunction early in life, we investigate the prefrontal–hippocampal communication at neonatal age in (a) mice mimicking the abnormal genetic background (22q11.2 microdeletion, DISC1 knockdown), (b) mice mimicking the challenge by environmental stressors (maternal immune activation during pregnancy), (c) mice mimicking the combination of both aetiologies (dual-hit models) and pharmacological mouse models. Simultaneous extracellular recordings in vivo from all layers of prelimbic subdivision (PL) of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and CA1 area of intermediate/ventral hippocampus (i/vHP) show that network oscillations have a more fragmented structure and decreased power mainly in neonatal mice that mimic both genetic and environmental aetiology of disease. These mice also show layer-specific firing deficits in PL. Similar early network dysfunction was present in mice with 22q11.2 microdeletion. The abnormal activity patterns are accompanied by weaker synchrony and directed interactions within prefrontal–hippocampal networks. Thus, only severe genetic defects or combined genetic environmental stressors are disruptive enough for reproducing the early network miswiring in mental disorders.},

Here, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics and chemogenetics in 4 to 12-day-old mice to address this knowledge gap. We show that ripples are robustly detected and induced by light stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons only from postnatal day 10 onwards. Leveraging a spiking neural network model, we mechanistically link the maturation of inhibition and ripple emergence. We corroborate these findings by reducing ripple rate upon chemogenetic silencing of CA1 interneurons.

We observed a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent phenomena in human and murine brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis.

	abstract = {The acute effects of anesthesia and their underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Thus, comprehensive analysis and efficient generalization require their description in various brain regions. Here we describe a large-scale, annotated collection of 2-photon calcium imaging data and multi-electrode, extracellular electrophysiological recordings in CA1 of the murine hippocampus under three distinct anesthetics (Isoflurane, Ketamine/Xylazine and Medetomidine/Midazolam/Fentanyl), during natural sleep, and wakefulness. We cover several aspects of data quality standardization and provide a set of tools for autonomous validation, along with analysis workflows for reuse and data exploration. The datasets described here capture various aspects of neural activity in hundreds of pyramidal cells at single cell resolution. In addition to relevance for basic biological research, the dataset may find utility in computational neuroscience as a benchmark for models of anesthesia and sleep.},

	abstract = {The mouse cortex is a canonical model for studying how functional neural networks emerge, yet it remains unclear which topological features arise from intrinsic cellular organization versus external regional cues. Mouse forebrain organoids provide a powerful system to investigate these intrinsic mechanisms. We generated dorsal (DF) and ventral (VF) forebrain organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells and tracked their development using longitudinal electrophysiology. DF organoids showed progressively stronger network-wide correlations, while VF organoids developed more refined activity patterns, enhanced small-world topology, and increased modular organization. These differences emerged without extrinsic inputs and may be driven by the increased generation of Pvalb+ interneurons in VF organoids. Our findings demonstrate how variations in cellular composition influence the self-organization of neural circuits, establishing mouse forebrain organoids as a tractable platform to study how neuronal populations shape cortical network architecture.},
